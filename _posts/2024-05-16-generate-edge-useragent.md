## Generated Random Edge User Agent with (UserAgenter)

When developing web scraping or testing tools, it's crucial to mimic real user behavior to avoid detection and ensure smooth operation. The UserAgenter library provides a convenient and efficient way to generate random Edge user agents, giving your Python applications the ability to simulate various versions of the Edge browser. This functionality is essential for maintaining diversity in user agent strings, making it harder for websites to identify and block your requests based on repetitive user agent patterns.

With UserAgenter, you can effortlessly integrate random Edge user agent generation into your projects. Whether you're performing web scraping, automation, or testing, this library simplifies the process and enhances the reliability of your scripts. By leveraging UserAgenter, you can focus on the core aspects of your project while ensuring that your application remains undetectable and performs seamlessly across different browsing environments.
Example: Creating an Agent with Chrome Browser

Here's an example of how to use UserAgenter to create a random Edge user agent:


```python
from UserAgenter import UserAgent

# User Agent Class
ua = UserAgent()

# Edge User Agent 
random_edge_agent = ua.RandomEdgeAgent()
```
