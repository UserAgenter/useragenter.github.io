## Generated Random Opera User Agent with (UserAgenter)

In the world of web scraping and automation, having a dynamic and varied user agent can significantly improve your chances of bypassing detection and getting the data you need. Our Python library, UserAgenter, offers a simple and efficient way to generate random Opera user agents. This helps you mimic real browsing behavior and avoid blocks or bans while interacting with websites. The UserAgenter library is easy to use and integrates seamlessly into your existing projects.

With UserAgenter, you can create a wide range of user agents that simulate requests from different versions and platforms of the Opera browser. This can be particularly useful for testing how your website behaves under various conditions or for scraping websites that employ strict anti-bot measures. Below, we provide an example of how to generate a random Opera user agent and use it to create an agent with the Chrome browser.


```python
from UserAgenter import UserAgent

# User Agent Class
ua = UserAgent()

# Safari User Agent 
random_safari_agent = ua.RandomSafariAgent()
```
